# FindMyShoes
 Search avaibility of a pair of shoes at vans.com.br

I did an python app to initialize with windows that will notify me when the pair of shoes that I want is avaiable.

-The notification will be sent through windows notifications with a url configured, so if you click at the notification you will be redirectly to the site.

-The link of the shoes shoud be configured as the example below:
shoesUrl = "linkoftheshoe.com"

-The size shoud be configured as the following example:
shoesSize= 39

-The interval of search should be configured like the example below:
searchInterval = 300

-Set the app to run automatically when you start your device:
Press Windows + R to open the run app, enter "shell:startup", then click in "ok", it'll open the startup folder where you should put this app.
